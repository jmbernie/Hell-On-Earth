Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever

(Tupac)
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

(Shock G)
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

(Money B)
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please

Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around

(Shock G)
Round and round, round we go




<lyrics>
How long will they mourn me
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato
It's still on nigga
Thug Life, Thugs for life
Ha Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me
Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka

(Tupac)

All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry
Instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
Then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn)
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?


I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)

(Syke)

How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'lac
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
Ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me?


I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Yeah)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)

(Rated R)

Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me?

()

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me?


Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit,
Nate Dogg do that shit nigga)
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother

(Tupac)
Under Pressure
Yeah, Baby
When tha pressures on...
Thug Life
When it's on it's on

(Tupac)
One of these days I'll learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
'Cause they turn into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound
When they posten bail
Smokin' blunts in tha driveway
My four-five screamin fuck tha police
Won't fly away, thug, till I die
You wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out
I was raised this way of thinkin'
These are tha dreams of a young teen
Sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
One time can't hold me one of these days
We gotta bust back for tha homies
Locked down in tha penitentry
Finally loose my mind if tha pigs succeed
Stress, smoken weed and nicoteen
But what a nigga really need is Thorozine
Right before I die I'll be curseing tha law
Reincarnated bitch even worse than before
My four-four's givin' payback
My underhanded plan
To get them niggas while they laid back
And big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
Servin' suckers like dope fiends
And lead tha whole team

Under Pressure Nigga
That's right

(Stretch)
Never run throw your gun in tha air
Oh yeah nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up
And with tha stainless steel (???), we cut shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness
Cock tha four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell
But when I'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell nigga I stand to tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl, givin' my all
So niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocain and lay they ass down 'G'

Under Pressure

(Tupac)
Yeah, look here tho

Runnin' wild
I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about tha past, it was all bad
Shots blasted will I last in tha wrong path
In tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief
Mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick? 'cause I'm addicted to get splifted
Watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothens changed cause in tha came it's a steady aim
Fuck friends 'cause when in danger those niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock G
Call Ki's and Hennessy where tha glock be
Times passen will I last here another day
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's getten hectic I can't call it
House full of alcoholics
Now we're niggas under pressure

Yeah, that's right...
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
Yeah

(Tupac and Stretch together repeated 11x)
When tha Pressures on it's a hit
Ski mask
Extra Gats
Bring tha clips
Don't nobody move when we walk tha streets
They stay silent
Cause talk is cheap

<lyrics>
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh, ooh
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose...
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Oah, oahhhah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oh-hah
(2Pac) Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) 'Cause it's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Hey!
(2Pac) Me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) I got nothing to lose

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah... ooh-ooh
(2Pac) It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahhhoh
(2Pac) Ha ha
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-ah, HA-Ah!
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world, hoah
(2Pac) Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-hah (hehe) hey!

Verse Three: 2Pac

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahah
(2Pac) I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world

Outro: 2Pac

Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

(Girl) Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world

<lyrics>
You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey, I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (and dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)

Sweet lady
Lady (dear mama)
Lady
Lady

<lyrics>
(2Pac) Ah yeah
(Down) Yeauh
(2Pac) It's all about you, one time
(Down) I'ma say it's all about you baby, yeah
(2Pac) Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you
It's all about you
(Down) This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac
YouknowhatI'msayin?
(2Pac) It's all about you
(Down) Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

(2Pac)
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' Boo, is this is all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(2Pac)
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
'Cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you... hahaha, yeah nigga
It's all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Snoop Doggy Dogg *speaking over last two lines*)
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean... god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin' back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah

(2Pac *singing in background* 2X)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!)

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

(2Pac *singing in background starts to overlap/repeat*)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah...

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

(2Pac)
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin' attention
To my amibitions as a ridah

Chorus: 2Pac

(Singing) I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(Singing) My ambitions as a ridah
(Singing) Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Tupac)
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it... it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


(Tupac)
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

Motherfuckin condoms Have one on us aight?
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

(2Pac)
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

(Snoop)
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

(2Pac)
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown
The shit's about to go down
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm Losin My Religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggaz be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but love, for my niggaz livin' lavish

(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted

-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
(Tupac) Nothin' but a gangsta party... Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

Motherfuckin gangsta party
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

(2Pac)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(Hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

(Snoop)
It's like 'cause, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin' dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and 'bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Chorus (w/ variations to end)

<lyrics>
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these

Nights full of Alizé, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that

They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries

Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die

I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

<lyrics>
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, nahmean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
(Danny Boy) I ain't...
Givin' a motherfuck, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
(Danny Boy) ...mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Verse One: 2Pac

Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

Chorus: Danny Boy

I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

Verse Two: 2Pac

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin 'n' grindin wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

Chorus: Danny Boy

I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

Verse Three: 2Pac

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Till God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

Chorus: Danny Boy
Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad (2Pac: hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha, no
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm

(Pac)
Clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!

Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

(Syke)
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin'!

(CPO)
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

(Pac)
We caught 'em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!

(CPO)
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker: I'mma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin'

(Pac)
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin', baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho?
Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police -- can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Mopreme
Can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? ... We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'

(The Lady of Rage)
Shit, you motherfuckin' right
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, Westside
What! Bring it on

(2Pac)
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind

(C'mon)
Our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin', fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steerin' wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire, exorcisin' all demons
Mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait...
To bust freely. Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Made the front-page, prime-time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend may be .45 but she still live
One shot makin' niggas heart beats stop

(The Lady of Rage)
What!
I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas - run, nigga, run!
I'm on your ass nigga! Run nigga - duck and hide!
Nigga I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga, yeah! Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

(2Pac)
My girlfriend - blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made, she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby-girl'll always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned .22, it's true
Nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'
Me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realise how to treat ya -
The secret to keep ya -
Bein' faithful (now) 'cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly; I shoot blind
In time I clock figures
Dropping niggas as we rise
We all souljah's in God eyes
Now it's time for war
Never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid
Sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang wit' the fellas
I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone
This is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed but you the realest
If you need me, call
I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall
Me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

I love finger fuckin' you
All of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut
Niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours
Behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore
Everything I'm asking for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy, you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you, "Be quiet"
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you
So no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone
I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home
Me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend

Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this whirlwind
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind
Look for me

Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Look for me

Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Look for me

Lost in the whirlwind

Me and my girlfriend...

Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend...

Meet my girlfriend!

Chorus: I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X)

I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
Why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto


Verse Two: 2Pac

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin' on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
In the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto


Verse Three: 2Pac

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

Chorus (to :27 from fade)

Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
(Soldier in the house)
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X to fade)

<lyrics>
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking 'bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm guna still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love

Verse One:

Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why God deserved to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying 'cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thang, with unconditional love

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Verse Two:

Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin' out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Verse Three:

I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatter us
Cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby don't cry cause everythang gonna be all right
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thang baby girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love

Chorus 3x until fade
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
