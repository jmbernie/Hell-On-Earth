"Bat Out Of Hell"

The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye
And a blade shining, oh, so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising,
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter,
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby, you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.
When it's over you know,
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone-gone-gone.
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done, and the sun goes down,
And the moonlight's shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry,
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole.
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I'd rather be damned with you.
Well, if I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you.
Well, if I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned—
Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned—
Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night—
Dancing through the night—
Dancing through the night with you.

Oh, baby, you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.
When it's over you know
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone gone gone.
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlight's shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe.
No one's gonna stop me now,
I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late.

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart
Still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away,
Like a bat out of hell.

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart
Still beating, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away,
Like a bat out of hell.
Like a bat out of hell.
Like a bat out of hell.
Oh, like a bat out of hell!
Like a bat out of hell!
Like a bat out of hell!

"You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)"

[Spoken:]
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Will he offer me his mouth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his teeth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his jaws?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Again, will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:]And will he starve without me?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:] And does he love me?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] I bet you say that to all the boys!

[Sung:]
It was a hot summer night
and the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
through your trembling hands.

You were licking your lips
and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
by the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to.
The night is young
And Ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.
You were licking your lips
and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
by the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

"Heaven Can Wait"

Heaven can wait,
And a band of Angels wrapped up in my heart,
Will take me through the lonely night,
Through the cold of the day.
And I know, I know,
Heaven can wait,
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me,
And the melody's gonna make me fly,
Without pain, without fear.

Give me all of your dreams,
And let me go alone on your way.
Give me all of your prayers to sing,
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day.
I got a taste of paradise,
I'm never gonna let it slip away.
I got a taste of paradise,
It's all I really need to make me stay
Just like a child again.

Heaven can wait.
And all I've got is time until the end of time.
I won't look back.
I won't look back.
Let the altars shine.

And I know that I've been released,
But I don't know to where,
And nobody's gonna tell me now,
And I don't really care. No, no, no.
I got a taste of paradise.
That's all I really need to make me stay.
I got a taste of paradise.
If I had it any sooner you know
You know I never would have run away from my home.

Heaven can wait.
And all I've got is time until the end of time.
I won't look back.
I won't look back.
Let the altars shine.

Heaven can wait.
Heaven can wait.
I won't look back.
I won't look back.
Let the altars shine.
Let the altars shine.
"All Revved Up With No Place To Go"

I was nothing but a lonely boy
Looking out for something new
And you were nothing but a lonely girl
But you were something
Something like a dream come true.

I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
When I played my guitar
I made the canyons rock, but
Every Saturday Night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

In the middle of a steamy night
I'm tossing in my sleep
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream

I see you coming
Coming on to give it to me

I was out on the prowl
Down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm the leader of the pack, but
Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

Oh baby I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest
I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me 'round about midnight
You and me 'round about midnight
Someone's got to draw first
Draw first
Someone's got to draw first blood
Someone's got to draw first blood
Ooh I got to draw first blood
Ooh I got to draw first blood
I was out on the prowl
Down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm the leader of the pack, but
Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy
Looking out for something new
And you were nothing but a all-American lonely girl
But you were something like a dream come true.
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
And when I played my guitar
I made the canyons rock, but
But every Saturday Night
I felt the fever grow
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
"Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad"

Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here

And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way
I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby
In a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding
At the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got

There's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her
Not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way
I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way
I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere

"Paradise By The Dashboard Light"

[Boy:]
I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
C'mon, hold on tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

[Girl:]
Ain't no doubt about it we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed

[Both:]
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby, got to go out and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

[Boy:]
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby, don't you hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No, you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes,
I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well, I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
C'mon, hold on tight

[Both:]
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely

[3x]
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night

[Radio Broadcast:]
OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
There's the wind-up, and there it is
A line shot up the middle, look at him go
This boy can really fly
He's rounding first and really turning it on now
He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second
The ball is bobbled out in the center
And here comes the throw and what a throw
He's gonna slide in head first
Here he comes, he's out
No, wait, safe, safe at second base
This kid really makes things happen out there
Batter steps up to the plate
Here's the pitch, he's going
And what a jump he's got
He's trying for third
Here's the throw
It's in the dirt, safe a third
Holy cow, stolen base
He's taking a pretty big lead out there
Almost daring them to pick him off
The pitcher glances over, winds-up and it's bunted
Bunted down the third base line
The suicide squeeze is on
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close
Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it

[Girl:]
Stop right there
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further

Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
And will you make me your wife?

Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
And will you make me your wife?

I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?

[Boy:]
Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning

[Girl:]
I gotta know right now
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
And will you make me your wife?
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
And will you love me forever?

What's it gonna be, boy?
Come on, I can wait all night.
What's it gonna be, boy?
Yes or no?
What's it gonna be, boy?
Yes or no?

[Boy:]
Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning
Let me sleep on it

[Girl:]
I gotta know right now
Do you love me
Will you love me forever
Do you need me

For the rest of my life
Will you take me away
And will you make me your wife

Do you love me
Will you love me forever

[Boy:]
Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning

I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
And will you love me forever?

[Boy:]
Let me sleep on it

[Girl:]
Will you love me forever

[Boy:]
I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god
And on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore I would love you to the end of time

So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all I can do (ooh, ooh)
I'm praying for the end of time
So I can end my time with you

[Boy:]
It was long ago and it was far away,
And it was so much better than it is today.

[Girl:]
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.

"For Crying Out Loud"

I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling
Before I reached the bottom

I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre
Could be burning
On the edge of the ice field

And now the chilly Californian wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper
In the chilly Californian sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
'Oh Babe, don't go'
And don't you hear me screaming
'How was I to know'

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment
To see the light of the day
And take me to another land
Where I don't have to stay
And I'm gonna need somebody
To make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody
With open arms, open eyes
Open up the sky and let the planet
That I love shine through

For crying out loud
You know I love you
[x3]

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved
I was kneeling
In the chains of my master

I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high
I was flying
Ah with you right above me

And now the chilly Californian wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper
In the chilly Californian sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
'Oh Babe, don't go'
And don't you hear me screaming
'How was I to know'

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment
To see the light of the day
And take me to another land
Where I don't have to stay
And I'm gonna need somebody
To make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody
With open arms, open eyes
Open up the sky and let the planet
That I love shine through

For crying out loud
You know I love you
[x4]

For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
My oh my, for that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
Don't you know for that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and for driving me home
For that I serve you

For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall
For revving me up when I'm starting to stall
And all in all for that I want you

For taking and for giving and for playing the game
For praying for my future in the days that remain
Oh Lord for that I hold you

Ah but most of all
For crying out loud
For that I love you
When you're crying out loud
You know I love you

"She Waits By The Window"

She waits by the window
To see if love is near
Her head on the pillow
She yields to tears

Standing in front of your light
Nothing is turning out right
Nothing comes out from inside
Nothing is turning out right
Ooh

She waits at the window
To see her tears
She's asking the question
Why he's not here it isn't clear

Standing in front of your light
Nothing is turning out right
Nothing comes out from inside
Nothing is turning out right
Ooh

Standing in front of your light
Nothing is turning out right
Nothing for her is in sight
Nothing is turning out right
Ooh

She waits at the window
To see if love is near
She's asking the question
Why he's not here it isn't clear
She's waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting
She waits at the window
She waits at the window

"Everything Under The Sun"

Everything under the sun
I hope we're going to get things done
Everything under the sun
There's something here for everyone
Just take a look inside
And surely you will see
That there's a little bit of good in everyone
And it's up to you and me

Everything under the sun
We're gonna lay the foundation
Everything under the sun
Total end to destruction
Everything under the sun
The answer's everlasting love
Everything under the sun
We're gonna get along as one

Just take a look inside
And surely you will see
That there's a little bit of good in everyone
And it's up to you and me

Everything under the sun
Brotherhood and salvation
Everything under the sun

Everything under the sun
Total end to destruction
Everything under the sun

Everything (everything)
Everything (everything)
Everything under the sun
Everything (everything)
Everything (everything)
Everything under the sun
Everything (everything)
Everything
"Read 'Em And Weep"

I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or firey speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted
The bullets are blanks

And everything's blank

[Chorus:]
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight

C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

[Chorus]

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted
The bullets are blanks, and everything's blank

[Chorus]

It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say, c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

Read 'em and weep - for all the hours we'll be spending alone
Read 'em and weep - for the dreams we'll ignore
Running silent and deep -And all those promises we promised to keep,
they won't be kept anymore

Read 'em and weep - for the magic that our bodies had made
Read 'em and weep - for the blood that we lost
Running silent and deep - and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost

Read 'em and weep - for the memories still alive in the bed
Read 'em and weep - for the lies we believed
Running silent and deep - and all the things that can never be said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's here in my eyes and it's all I can say
C'mon look at me and read 'em and weep

"I'll Kill You If You Don't Come Back"

From the minute I turned and laid my eyes on you, I had no eyes of my own
I was blind to the world, you were too good to be true
But you were something to see, so very young and alone
And I still don't believe the way you turned on me
Now where's the girl that I knew?
I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love
You gave me nothing but trouble, man, I've been such a fool
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games

[Chorus:]
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games
You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack
Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack
In every way I want you out of my life
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back

In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close
And then you'd hold me so tight
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light
And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud
I know you're laughing at me
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

[Chorus]

Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach
They're dreamin' of boys and staying just out of reach
Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track
They're glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs
Bless all the girls in the gangs on the street
They're looking for danger and they're holding their peace
Bless all the girls staying late after school
They're playing with fire and oh they're playing it cool
And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance
They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance
Bless all the girls who are always alone
They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone
Bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about
They try not to cry and then they try to put out

And bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about
They try not to cry and then they try to put out

Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met
But damn you and curse you after all that you've done
You're the one girl I'll never forget
You're the one girl I'll never forget
Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do
But damn me and curse me for still needing you

And I'll kill you if you don't come back
I'll kill you if you don't come back (repeats out)
"Fallen Angel"

I took one look and something snapped inside,
I said I love your eyes
You took my heart, you took my breath away,
I felt my temperature rise
You said you've never loved a man this way
That it was heaven you were here to stay

[Chorus:]
And now you're just another fallen angel
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm
And now you're just another fallen angel
Falling into somebody else's arms

I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,
you had me hypnotized
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch

[Chorus]

Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me
To love and to comfort you
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air -
I'll be there

You said you've never loved a man this way
That it was heaven you were here to stay
"Standing On The Outside"

I ain't livin' here no more
I ain't even keepin' score
It's too late to change, it's over
I'm drowned in a sea of tears

Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference
There ain't nothin' I can do
None of it's makin' sense

[Chorus:]
Standing on the outside
Lookin' in at you
Standing on the outside
I'm running out of time

I'm so tired of being alone
In a world that feels so cold
There's got to be a light that I can find
There's got to be a soul somewhere that shines for me

Now I don't want to live without love anymore
I just wanna live my life
Love's gonna open up the door
Show me it's light again

[Chorus]

Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference
There ain't nothin' I can do
None of it's makin' sense

[Chorus]
"One More Kiss (Night Of The Soft Parade)"

[Part One]

At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming
The cars and the beast behind all start humming
And ooh you got a cool machine
So let's get it runnin'
We'll break the silence of the night
And you know they're gonna hear us comin'

We always see them whisper
We know they're gonna talk
They fantsise the mysteries
'bout the night and the dark

So baby one more kiss
Baby one more kiss
We never have to say goodbye
And baby one more kiss
Babay one more kiss
It brings a little luck to the night

Artists they got their easels
They're ready on the mark
Gonna try and take the pictures of the dust
and the gold in the sparks
And ooh you got a cool machine
Baby let's get it runnin'
You never looked so good before
and your time it's finally comin'

'Cause our home is the wind
We're the gods of the mornin'
Champions of the night
when the engines are runnin'

So just one more kiss
Baby one more kiss
Never wanna see you cry
And baby one more kiss
Baby one more kiss
It brings a little luck to the night
Oh one more kiss

Under my foot gonna hit it down
Take this stance before the crowd
Sleepin' city urban fall
Summer's sadness time to answer the call

Cool machine

Ready to roll

Soft hands around my neck
One more kiss then time to connect
Leave this child leave me all alone
This one's mine and I'm takin' it home

Ready Ready

[Part Three]

New histories start to rise
Of the soft parade
and the heroes where they lie
And ooh you've got a cool machine
So baby let's get it runnin'
You never looked so good before

Brings a little luck to the night

Ooh one more kiss
One more kiss
Baby one more kiss
We never have to say goodbye
And ooh you've got a cool machine
Baby let's get it runnin...

"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)"

And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no
No way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that,
No I won't do-

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight

And I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

And some days I pray for Silence
And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that, No
No. No, I won't do that!

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way

And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

[Girl:]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

[Boy:]
I can do that!
I can do that!

[Girl:]
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white!
Can you make it all a little less old

[Boy:]
I can do that!
Oh, Oh, I can do that!

[Girl:]
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an Emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

[Boy:]
I can do that
I can do that

[Girl:] 
Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will ya hose me down with holy water - If I get too hot?
Will you take me to places I'll never know?

[Boy:]
I can do that!
I can do that!

[Girl:]
After a while you'll forget everything
Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on

[Boy:]
I won't do that
I won't do that

[Girl:]
I know the territory - I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

[Boy:]
I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love!
I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that...
"Life Is A Lemon And I Want My Money Back"

It's all or nothing
And nothing's all I ever get
Ev'ry time I turn it on, I burn it up and burn it out

It's always something
There's always something going wrong
That's the only guarantee, that's what this is all about

It's a never ending attack
Ev'rything's a lie and that's a fact
Life is a lemon and I want my money back

And all the morons
And all the stooges with their coins
They're the ones who make the rules, it's not a game it's just a rout

There's desperation
There's desperation in the air
It leaves a stain on all your clothes and no detergent gets it out

And we're always slipping through the cracks
Then the movie's over, fade to black
Life is a lemon and I want my money back

I want my money back
I want my money back

What about love?
It's defective! It's always breaking in half

What about sex?
It's defective! It's never built to really last

What about your family?
It's defective! All the batteries are shot

What about your friends?
They're defective! All the parts are out of stock

What about hope?
It's defective! It's corroded and decayed

What about faith?
It's defective! It's tattered and it's frayed

What about you gods?
They're defective! They forgot the warranty

What about your town?
It's defective! It's a dead-end street to me

What about your school?
It's defective! It's a pack of useless lies

What about your work?
It's defective! It's a crock and then you die

What about your childhood?
It's defective! It's dead and buried in the past

What about your future?
It's defective! And you can shove it up your ass

Oh, I want my money back
I want my money back

It's all or nothing
And nothing's all I ever get
Ev'ry time I turn it on, I burn it up and burn it out

It's a never ending attack
Ev'rything's a lie and that's a fact
Life is a lemon and I want my money back

And we're always slipping through the cracks
Then the movie's over, fade to black
Life is a lemon and I want my money back

I want my money back
I want my money back
"Good Girls Go To Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)"

When the wind is howling through your window pane,
it's not the only pain of the night
You're burning up in your bed, you've got a fever of love,
and there's not an antibody in sight

Hey Jenny, Jenny, why are you crying?
There's a beauty of a moon in the sky
But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life,
you never lift your head and look so high

You don't have a lot
But it's all that you've got, and you can turn it into more than it seems
Just give it a shot, fantasize every movement,
and imagine every inch of your dream

No-one said it had to be real, but it's got to be something you can reach out and feel now
It ain't right, it ain't fair
Castles fall in the sand, and we fade in the air,
and the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere
Good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere
Somebody told me so
Somebody told me, now I know
Every night in my prayer,
I'll be praying that the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere

When the sweat is sizzling on your skin in the dark,
and you're desperate now for somewhere to turn
Every muscle in rebellion, every nerve is on edge,
and every limb has been erotically burned

Hey Johnny, Johnny, why are you shaking,
when a boy should do whatever he can
You've been nothing but an angel every day of your life,
and now you wonder what it's like to be damned

You don't have a lot
But it's all that you've got, and you can turn it into more than it seems
Just give it a shot, fantasize every movement,
and imagine every inch of your dream

No-one said it had to be real, but it's got to be something you've been wanting to feel now
It ain't right, it ain't fair
Castles fall in the sand, and we fade in the air,
and the good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere
Good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere
Somebody told me so
Somebody told me, now I know
Every night in my prayer,
I'll be praying that the good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere

Every time I try and dream you,
I can't believe how hard it's been to conjure up your face and trace your body in the air
Oh the seconds go on for ever, but the thirds and the fourth ones are even better
Every time I do it just a little bit longer
Every time I dream it's just a little bit stronger, than real life

No-one said it had to be real, but it's got to be something you can reach out and feel now
It ain't right, it ain't fair
Castles fall in the sand, and we fade in the air,
and the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere
Good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere
Somebody told me so
Somebody told me, now I know
Every night in my prayer,
I'll be praying that the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere

Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere
Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere
Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere
Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere

Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere
"Lost Boys And Golden Girls"

Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all around the world
Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all round, all around the world

It doesn't matter where they're going or wherever they've been,
'cause they've got one thing in common it's true
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste,
and let me tell you something, neither will you, neither will you

We gotta be fast
We were born out of time, born out of time and alone
And we'll never be as young as we are right now, running away and running for home,
running for home

[Instrumental]

It doesn't matter where they're going or wherever they've been,
'cause they've got one thing in common it's true
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste,
and let me tell you something, neither will you, neither will you

Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all around the world
Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all around, all around the world
"Man Of Steel"

I'm so afraid to draw you close
Hold me
Before my hands fall away
I'll suffocate
If I can't breathe you in
And hold you there
Forever

I left a message at the hotel
They said you checked out
They said you ain't coming back
I tried to call you
But you turned off your cell
And it said at the tone
Just leave me alone

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all my strength was gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel

I built this prison that I thought was a home
And we both lived here
Guess you were living alone
I'd tear it down if you would only have asked
And I would build you a bridge
So you could come back

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all your fears were gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
[Girl:] Hey, now tell me why can't you just break my heart?
I used to be an man of steel
And I used to take you in my arms
[Girl:] I loved you from the start
Now you can't tear my world apart

I used to be a man of steel
Now every bit of faith is gone
[Girl:] You used to be so strong
Now you can't even break my heart
I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms
What's it going to take for us to break down?
And finally fall
Apart at the seams
It seems that I always fall apart
[Girl:] As strong as you are...
As strong as I am...
Why can't you break my heart?

"The Monster Is Loose"

I've been living my life in a cage
Freedom spits in my face
It was such a disgrace
And I was lonely
And feeling empty
Desperate

I had my head in a noose
I had nothing to loose
Had enough of abuse
And now I'm dangerous
Hateful, contagious
It haunts us

I'm angry (I'm angry)
I'm raging (I'm raging)
I'm breaking through the pain

The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me can you feel it
As you hit the wall

The monsters loose
And now you have to choose
And prove you can take it
To the top before you fall

I've walked a slippery road
Felt a twitch in my soul
Through the wind and the cold
With no protection
Just one direction
Destruction

I've paid for all my mistakes
Taking all I can take
Until I'm ready to break
I'm feeling vicious
And so outrageous
It breaks us

I'm leaving
Still breathing
I'm tearing through these chains

The monster's loose
And as you know the truth
Tell me can you feel it
As you hit the wall

The monster's loose
And now you have to choose
And prove you can take it
To the top and never fall

[Musical interlude]

I've lived a thousand years in darkness
Banished all alone
Inside my mind with just my madness
Behind these walls of stone

I was falling apart at the seams
Holding my breath just to breathe
I tasted the sting of my tears

[Musical interlude]

I was waking up stuck in a dream
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed
Wasted away by my fears

OOOOOOO

[Musical interlude]

The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me can you feel it
As you hit the wall

The monster's loose
And now you have to choose
And prove that you can take it
To the top and never fall

The monster's loose
You've lost your last excuse
Now show me that you got it
Even when you fall

The monster's loose
This game is win or loose
Sometimes you gotta' do it
And show the world you want it all

Yeahhhhhhaw
Yeahhhhhhaw
Yeahhhhhhaw
Yeahhhhhhaw

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhaw

"It's All Coming Back To Me Now"
(feat. Marion Raven)

[Boy:] There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it right outside the window
[Girl:] There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust and I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

[Both:]
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I have ever made

[Boy:]
But when you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And you hold me like that (hold me like that)
I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this (touch you like this)
And I hold you like that (hold you like that)
It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me now

[Girl:]
It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now

[Boy:]
There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow-baby, baby!

If I kiss you like this (kiss you like this)
And if you whisper like that (whisper like that)
It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me

If you want me like this (if you want me like this)
And if you need me like that (if you need me like that)
It was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me

It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now....

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then!

But if I touch you like this (touch you like this)
And if you kiss me like that (kiss me like that)
It was so long ago but it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And if I kiss you like that (kiss you like that)
It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me now

[Girl:]
It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now

[Boy:]
There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again but they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow-baby, baby, baby!

When you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And when you hold me like that (hold me like that)
It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me

When you see me like this (see me like this)
And when I see you like that (see you like that)
Then we see what we want to see-all coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies-all coming back to me
I can barley recall, but it's all coming back to me now....

If you forgive me all this (forgive me all this)
If I forgive you all that (forgive you all that)
We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now

[Girl:] It's all coming back to me now
[Boy:] We forgive and forget
[Both:] And it's all coming back to me now....


"Blind As A Bat"

I'm not afraid to show you who I am
And I am not ashamed of my life
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road
I've always felt your heat in my bones

With every step I rise and fall
With everything to gain I end up losing it all
When the darkness gets in
I scream out and your light sets me free

I'm not afraid of the past no more
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good
I used to dance to the devil's beat
If I could bust into hell I would

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin
I'm not afraid of the faults you see
I'm tearing down these walls right now
They're comin' down 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

I'm not afraid when they kick me down
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed
I'm not afraid if I live or die
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

And I wish that I could give you something in return
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned

And in the end you'll finally see
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did

I'm not afraid of the things you know
I'm just a book for the world to read
My final words on the final page
Will be amends 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black
The way me forgive me and just take me back
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black
The way me forgive me and just take me back
Your love is blind, blind as bat...

"In The Land Of The Pig, The Butcher Is King"

Look at them now
What do they want?
And what do they do now?
Nothing at all!

What do they know?
What do they think?
And who do they tell?
Well, no one at all!

Lives are truely meaningless
And we are busy being blessed

With that we can take and pocket
No one needs to know
We're is the plug and they're the socket
Give us the juice and we'll go

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the animals sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!

How do they sleep?
Their lives are so tart
Bring me the trash collectors
'Cause they're nothing but trash

What do you expect?
They've got no standards
So we lower the bar
'Cause they're waiting for us

We'll open up Pandora's Box
Pandora gave her keys and locks

They're the big dogs waiting for their mother
Come to the confessional
So I can tell you all to bugger off
There's no time like now!

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the animals sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the market-place sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king...

And we'll do it our way
It's our time to play
We know what to say
They stand in our way
Don't stand in our way
No time like today...

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the anthems we sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the animals sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!

Can't you hear the choir now?
Listen to the chosen ones sing!
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king...

"If It Ain't Broke, Break It"

Hit it!

Everything I've ever dreamed of
Has begun to fade to black
Oh, I don't know where I ever lost love
Or where to go now to get it back

I'm a desperate, lonely child and I don't have enough
I've come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love

If it ain't real - fake it!
If it ain't yours - take it!
If it don't exist - you make it!
If it ain't broke - break it!

If it ain't real - fake it!
If it ain't yours - take it!
If it's gone to sleep - you wake it!
If it ain't broke - break it!

Gimme some words I can live by
Gimme commandments to know
Gimme some fables and proverbs
You gotta gimme some signs where to go

There are designated angels who just might save your soul, no!
They give me words to live by - and that's all that I know

If it ain't real - fake it!
If it ain't yours - take it!
If it don't exist - you make it!
If it ain't broke - break it!

If it ain't real - fake it!
If it ain't yours - take it!
If it's all gone bad - forsake it!
If it ain't broke - break it...

If it ain't broke - break it!

If it ain't real - fake it!
If it ain't yours - take it!
If it's gone to sleep - you wake it!
If it ain't broke - break it!

If it ain't real - fake it!

If it's all gone bad - forsake it!
And if it ain't broke - break it...

"What About Love?"
(feat. Patti Russo)

[Boy:]
There's a hole in the sky tonight
There the moon drift to far from sight
I would search thru this empty darkness
To see your face in the morning light

We've been lost in a sea of confusion
Got caught up in a selfish illusion
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break
Don't let fate make the choice for us

What about love that lasts forever?
What about time to see it through?
If you don't give you just don't get it
What about me?
What about you?

What about love?

[Girl:]
Once in a lifetime you'll find someone heaven send for you
For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe
In a love that's meant to be

[Boy:]
It feels like we've fallen from grace
Given up on the higher thing
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find
Something to give us wings

What about love that lasts forever?
What about time to see it through?
If you don't give you just don't get it?
What about me?
What about you?

What about love?

[Boy:]
I can't go on another day
Comin' home and seeing you cryin'
[Girl:]
Can't stand another night
Of telling you I'm tired when I'm dying

[Both:]
Forever means nothing
To live without you
Is reaching for something that never comes through
Together is heaven
Apart we're in hell
The time for forgiveness is now

Once in a lifetime you'll find
Someone to share your dreams
For a lifetime
Our love will always set us free
Forever we'll believe...

[Boy:]
I can't forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

[Girl:]
On a summernight's surrender with nothing to loose
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

[Both:]
What about love that lasts forever?
What about time to see it through?
If you don't give you just don't get it
What about me?
What about you?

What about love that won't say never?
When you don't know what you can do
If you don't live you just regret it
What about me?
What about you?

What about love?

"Cry To Heaven"

Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry to heaven
Say a prayer and light a candle
Toll a bell

Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry to heaven
If that doesn't do it for you
Go ahead, and cry like hell...

Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry to heaven
Storm the castle, stem the tide
Rise above yourself

Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry to heaven
If that doesn't do it for you
Go ahead, and cry like
Go ahead, and cry like
Go ahead, and cry like hell...
"Mad Mad World / The Good God Is A Woman And She Don't Like Ugly"
(feat. Chuck D)

["Mad Mad World":]

I was standing with my paper there, minding my own news
For everything that someone said someone else had a different view
I watched the whole thing there unfold upon my TV screen
"A new world order is on its way," well, just pass the popcorn please

You don't mean to tell me no one else is gonna get hurt
When there's folks at home who eat dog food and they can't afford a shirt

Sure find out real fast just who's a sitting duck
When it's a…

(mad, mad world)—shake your hands and say good luck
(mad, mad world)—I cannot believe this stuff
(mad, mad world)—getting madder every day
(mad, mad world)—get involved and they'll blow you away

Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck
Well, it's a mad, mad world

A little man sits up way high, way up above the crowd
Can you make them dance real fast, can you make them cheer out loud?
Money doesn't talk and yet it sounds like a big machine
A voice on high says you reap what you sow, just keep your own nose clean

(mad, mad world)—shake your hands and say good luck
(mad, mad world)—I cannot believe this stuff
(mad, mad world)—getting madder every day
(mad, mad world)—get involved and they'll blow you away

Sure find out real fast just when you've had enough
Well, it's a mad, mad world
(mad mad world) …

["The Good God Is A Woman And She Don't Like Ugly":]

[Chuck D.:]
She'll knock you right off this planet
To those opposed and take it for granted
Who knows it grows from those that planned it
Who ran for office and they can't stand it?
Who robbed and stole and took full advantage
And hide the shock with all them antics?
Whose souls exposed cause I dig granite
We rock and roll, they don't understand it
And damn the wack cuz they don't want it
Your gold and diamonds so what you bought it
You don't know what I know, you just sport it
Bodyguards scared but you still flaunt it
People died in them mines and they just caught it
Sly slick the wicked, do you support it?
Kicking ask me the questions, y'all know I taught it
Want war? Shut up! Cuz you ain't fought it…!

C'mon!
Terrrible
Power to the people
Put your hands in the air

Terrible
C'mon
C'mon!

["Mad Mad World":]

(mad, mad world)—shake your hands and say good luck
(mad, mad world)—I cannot believe this stuff
(mad, mad world)—getting madder every day
(mad, mad world)—get involved and they'll blow you away

Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck
That it's a mad, mad world
Well, it's a mad, mad worl
Well, it's a mad, mad world
Mad, mad world....
