"I Feel For You"

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you - I think I love you

To give you happiness

Stand up everybody, this is your life
Let me take u to another world, let me take u tonight
U don't need no money, u don't need no clothes
The Second Coming, anything goes
Sexuality is all u'll ever need
Sexuality - let your body be free

C'mon everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we gotta organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm OK as long as u are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need

Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize

Everybody...
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
One time say...
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize

We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists - 89 flowers on their back...inventors of the Accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera... What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are u listening?
We need a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed
No child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing

Stand Up, Organize
We need a new breed...Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
I wanna be in the new breed, Stand up, Organize
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality

Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around

You to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season

You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

"Little Red Corvette"

I guess I should've known by the way
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette

'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette
Right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground
(Honey, you got to slow down)

You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a Limousine

Ow, baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

Babe, you got to slow down
(Y got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't

You're gonna run your body right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)

"Delirious"

I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face

I just can't win a race

'Cuz I get delirious (Delirious)
Delirious (Delirious)
Delirious (Delirious)

I get delirious when you hold my hand (Delirious)
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand

And girl I got a lot

I get delirious (Delirious) (Yeah)
Delirious (Delirious)
Delirious (Delirious)

Girl you gotta take control 'cuz I just can't steer
You're just 2 much 2 take

In and out and around your lake

I'm delirious (Delirious)
You, you, you get me delirious (Delirious)
Baby, lay me down

"Let's Go Grazy"

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one - Dr Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
Uh uh was all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no Let's Go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
U better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll be alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and dafodills will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!
"Take Me With U"

I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes what can I say
They turn me on

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do

Don't care where we go

You're sheer perfection (thank u)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night

Where is my love life?
Where can it be?
There must be something wrong with the machinery

Where is my love life?
Tell me, tell me
Where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Until I find the righteous 1
Computer blue
Until I find the righteous 1

"Darling Nikki"

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

[backwards at the end...]
"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."
"When Doves Cry"

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe you're just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Don't Cry (Don't Cry)

When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry

When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

"I Would Die 4 U"

I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain

If you know what I'm singing about up here
C'mon, raise your hand

Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you, only want to see you

"We Can Fuck"

I could tell you stories until you get tired
I could play with your mind
But you'd probably say that I was a liar
So I won't waste your time
I'm scared because though we just met
There's this energy between us
Let's just go somewhere, we can fuck

I could say I'm sorry all of my life
That wouldn't be true.
I only say and do the things that I do
'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm scared because though we just met
I want you so bad, baby
Don't you want to come with me
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck

No, this isn't something I've said many times before
But what difference does it make?
That was them, this is you
Oh, can't you see this room is electric?
Okay, well then maybe it's me,
but I know the smell of desire,
honey, it's all over you

I could tell you things to get you excited, things you never heard
You know the Kama Sutra?
I could re-write it with half as many words
I'm scared, because if I don't kiss you
I'm going to go mad, baby
Take off my clothes
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
[2x]

Wait a minute, let me turn on some lights
(We can fuck)
Is that better?
Come here
You can blow the candle off baby
You can turn the candle on
Which ever one you choose is alright
Because we're going to do it all night long
Do you want to...
Undress me, babe
Shall I undress you?
You can leave your clothes on if you want to
And I can still do all I want to do to you
Sex between two people is alright
Whether they're in love or not
As long as they're not trying to hurt nobody
Just as long as it's hot
Baby, I want to make love to you
Two times maybe three
Yeah, if you want to go four or five, baby that's alright with me
Let me tell you, I will be your little baby
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
I can be your girl or boy
I can be your toy
Alright, let's dance
It's up to you
You can fuck me, baby
I'll fuck you
We can fuck one another
Whatever you want to do
You got an electric ass, baby
You got electric thighs, baby
Ow, I can't wait no longer, child
It's getting stronger, baby
Open up your eyes
Ow!
See this gold chain around my waist?
Yeah, I want to give it to you
When people tell me I got no taste
Blow this candle out
Let's see if it's true

Oh baby, this is excellent
No, no, it is really
It's like
I'm sorry, it's just
I don't know
I've just never felt this way before
No, I'm really happy, really
Well, I guess, I met you and I just don't deserve it
Because you're so special
No I'm not, not like you
You're perfect
You really are
There are so many things I want to do with you
There are so many things I want to do for you
Listen, don't ever love anybody else
You don't have any reason to feel insecure
You're the best
Would you believe that?
No one can ever, ever, hurt you
Yes, I love you
I know it sounds strange, but I do
I do
I knew I loved you the split second before we kissed
Oh darling, kiss me now
Wait
Please fuck me again
"Paisley Park"

1, 2, 1, 2, 3

There is a park that is known
4 the face it attracts
Colorful people whose hair
On 1 side is swept back
The smile on their faces
It speaks of profound inner peace
Ask where they're going
They'll tell U nowhere
They've taken a lifetime lease
On Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

There is a woman who sits
All alone by the pier
Her husband was naughty
And caused his wife so many tears
He died without knowing forgiveness
And now she is sad, so sad
Maybe she'll come 2 the park
And forgive him
And life won't be so bad
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

See the man cry as the city
Condemns where he lives
Memories die but taxes
He'll still have 2 give
(who) Whoever said that elephants
Were stronger than mules?
Come 2 the park
And play with us
There aren't any rules
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

Your heart, your heart
Paisley Park
Your heart, your heart, your heart (sing, sing it)
Paisley Park

"Around The World In A Day"

Open your heart, open your mind
A train is leaving all day
A wonderful trip through our time
And laughter is all U pay

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day

Now dig
Loneliness already knows U
There ain't no reason 2 stay
Come here and take my hand, I'll show U
I think I know a better way, y'all

Around the world in a day
(listen 2 me, babe)
Around the world in a day
(all the babies sing it now)

Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
No-sha-sha
No shouting
No shouting
No - no shouting

The little 1 will escort U
2 places within your mind
The former is red, white, and blue
The ladder is purple, come on and climb

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
Come on, sing
Around the world in a day
Say papa, I think I wanna dance

(summer she is sweet)

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
All the little babies, sing around the world
Around the world in a day

A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
A nation of alms, the production, sharing ideas, a shower of flowers

"Raspberry Beret"

1 2 1 2 3

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No No No
No No No (The kind you find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love.
