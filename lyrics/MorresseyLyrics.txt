Panic on the streets of London 
Panic on the streets of Birmingham 
I wonder to myself 
Could life ever be sane again? 
The leeds side-streets that you slip down 
I wonder to myself 
Hopes may rise on the grasmere 
But honey pie, you're not safe here 
So you run down 
To the safety of the town 
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle 
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside 
I wonder to myself 

Burn down the disco 
Hang the blessed DJ 
Because the music that they constantly play 
It says nothing to me about my life 
Hang the blessed DJ 
Because the music they constantly play 

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down 
The provincial towns you jog 'round 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ 
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ

<lyrics>
Ordinary boys, 
Happy knowing nothing
Happy being no-one but themselves
Ordinary girls, 
Supermarket clothes
Who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
For you were so different
You stood all alone
And you knew
That it had to be so
Avoiding ordinary boys
Happy going nowhere, just around here
In their rattling cars
Ordinary girls
Never seeing further
Than the cold, small streets
That trap them
But you were so different
You had to say no
When those empty fools
Tried to change you, and claim you
For the lair of their ordinary world
Where they feel so lucky
So lucky, so lucky
With their lives laid out before them
They are lucky
So lucky, so lucky
So lucky, so...

Uno due tre
Well, if you don't like it
Go ahead, find yourself a saint
Go ahead now, try to find a boy
Who's gonna be all the things I ain't
What you need is a plastic doll
With a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always act so quaint
Oh yeah yeah yeah

With your new friends
You're really making a scene
I've seen you bouncing around
From machine to machine
And you know
They're never real
They're never what they seem
And you can try to generate some warmth
And you see just what I mean
Oh yeah yeah yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Well, that's 'cause I'm a human being
I want too many things
And that's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being

And I just go around with my head hung down
Just like a human being and all those human beings
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, I'm a riffraff human being

Won't you give me a little sip
Why don't you try me on a drag of that cigarette
Why don't you try to give me something that
I'll never ever forget
But now don't you blow it all
On a million dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On the best lovin' you've had yet
Oh yeah yeah yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Well that's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being

And I just go around with my head hung down
Just like a human being and all those human beings
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, I'm a riff raff human being

In fact I'm talking about the human race
Trying to cover up the big disgrace
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Well I may think that this whole scene
Is too appalling for me
Or I may be the type who is just a mad about
Everything that I see
But I can't cover this with history
Or make it just what I want it to be
I'm blowing my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees
Said yeah yeah, oh yeah

And If I'm acting like a king
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being

Ouija board
Would you work for me?
I have got to say 'Hello'
To an old friend

Ouija board, ouija board, ouija board
Would you work for me?
I have got to get through
To a good friend

Well, she has now gone
From this Unhappy Planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructors on it

Ouija board, ouija board, ouija board
Would you help me?
Because I still do feel
So horribly lonely

Would you, ouija board
Would you, ouija board
Would you help me?
And I just can't find
My place in this world

She has now gone
From this Unhappy Planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructors of it

Oh, hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Oh, hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")

The table is rumbling ...
The table is rumbling
The glass is moving
"No, I was NOT pushing that time"
It spells: S.T.E.V.E.N
The table is rumbling
The glass is moving
"No, I was NOT pushing that time" :
P.U.S.H.O. double F.

Well, she has now gone
From this Unhappy Planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructors of it

Our unsleepable friend gets the message on an ill-wind
"All your friends and your foes
Would rather die than have to touch you"

To say the least
Oh, truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly

Drank too much and then said too much
And there's nowhere to go but down
Young boy, I wanna help you

See these lines?
Truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly

Don't talk to me, no
About people who are "nice"
'Cause I have spent my whole life
In ruins
Because of people who were "nice"
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
Each bud must blossom and grow

Young girl, one day you will be old
But the thing is I love you now

This is the last song I will ever sing
No, I've changed my mind again
Goodnight and thank you

For whether you stay
Or you stray
An inbuilt guilt
That catches up with you
And as it comes around to your place
At 5 a.m. wakes you up
And it laughs in your face

Ah ha ha ha ha ha

We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse and

There is a place

For me and my friends
And when we go
We all will go
So you see
I'm never alone
There is a place
With a bit more time
And a few more
Gentler words
And looking back
We will forgive
(We had no choice
We always did)
All that we hope
Is when we go
Our skin
And our blood
And our bones
Don't get in your way
Making you ill
The way they did
When we lived
Oh, there is a place
A place in hell
Reserved
For me and my friends
And if ever I
Just wanted to cry
Then I will
Because I can

With no-one to catch me

<lyrics>

I came back to my old city 
With fierce determination 
And I couldn't find my way out of the station 

It's all changed 
You were there 
Departing, starting 
A trek I had once took 
With that "no-one's gonna stop me when I feel this way" look 


Apparent, apparent 
Heir apparent 
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't 
But you may change minds with your winning smile 


I fell down in my old city 
Such sad degradation 
So I tried to make my way back to the station 

You were still there 
Gleaming and leaving 
Wide-eyed and awestruck 
Saying "How can anybody hate me 
If I love them first off ?" 


Apparent, apparent 
Heir apparent 
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't 
But you may change minds with your winning smile 


Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir 
But you may be OK, I don't know 


I'll see you back here 
In a few bruised years 
Pray 
I'll see you here 
I'll see you here 
I'll see you here 


Apparent, apparent 
Heir apparent 
You say that you want it, I'm sure that you'll get it 
They'll seduce your heart and then they'll slap your arse 


Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir 
Heir, heir, heir

<lyrics>
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

When you say it's gonna happen now
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See, I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
</lyrics>

Stop me, oh, stop me 
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before 
Stop me, oh, stop me 
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before 

Nothing's changed 
I still love you, oh, I still love you 
Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love 

I was delayed, I was way-laid 
An emergency stop 
I smelt the last ten seconds of life 
I crashed down on the crossbar 
And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald, Buddhist reflect 
And plan a mass murder 
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never
Who said I'd lied because I never? 

I was detained, I was restrained 
And broke my spleen and broke my knee 
And then he really laced into me
Friday night in-out patients 
Who said I'd lied to her? 

Oh, who said I'd lied? Because I never, I never 
Who said I'd lied? Because I never 

And so I drank one 
It became four 
And when I fell on the floor
I drank more 

Stop me, oh, stop me 
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before 
Stop me, oh, stop me 
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before 

Nothing's changed 
I still love you, oh, I still love you 
Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I'm doing very well
I can block out the present and the past now
I know by now you think I should have straightened myself out
Thank you, drop dead

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no love in modern life

I'm doing very well
It's a miracle I've even made it this far
The motion of taxis excite me
When you peel it back and bite me?

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no hope in modern life

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can't fight
No true friends in modern life

Diazapam that's Valium
Temazepam, Lithium
HRT, ECT, how long must I stay on this stuff?

Please don't give anymore
Don't give anymore
Don't give anymore
Please don't give anymore
Don't give anymore
Don't give anymore
Please don't give anymore

Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No No No - It is Murder
No No No - It is Murder
And who hears when animals cry?

Park the car at the side of the road
You should know
Time's tide will smother you
And I will too
When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid
It doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down

It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face, after all

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine

(Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
'Cause I don't care
I should like to see my...
I don't bless them)

(Farewell...)
To this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing

I say: "Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?"

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other

Oh has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed or have I changed?

As some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs
(I swear to God, I swear)
I never even knew what drugs were

And so I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know you and you cannot sing!"
I said: "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano!"

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron
No one talks about castration

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
Oh, oh
These are the things that kill me

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
Oh
These are the things that kill me

(All their life, they make love, and pierce through me)

Passed the Pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Passed the Pub that wrecks your body
And the church - all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

(Life is very long when you're lonely)

(Life is very long when you're lonely)

(Life is very long when you're lonely)

(Life is very long when you're lonely)

Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed, I still love you
Oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough
To make a shy, bald Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied, because I never, I never
Who said I lied, because I never

I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen and broke my knee
And then he really lays into me
Friday night in Outpatients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I lied, because I never, I never
Who said I lied, because I never

And so I drank one, it became four
And when I fell on the floor, I drank more

Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed, I still love you
Oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

<lyrics>
Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

So tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one?

This story is old
I know, but it goes on
This story is old
I know, but it goes on

It goes on

<lyrics>
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil and you lie
And if you should die, I may feel slightly sad but I won't cry

Loved and lost and some may say
When usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?
I say no, I'm gonna kill my dog
May the lines sag, the lines sag heavy and deep tonight

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil and you lie
And if you should die, I may feel slightly sad but I won't cry

Loved and lost and some may say
When usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?
I said no and then I shot myself
So drink, drink, drink and be ill tonight

From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind

Behind, behind, behind
Behind, behind, behind
Oh, unhappy birthday
</lyrics>
